Let =R= be a recipe composed of =n= ingredients. Each ingredient is denoted by its amount of calories =c=. The recipe =R= has a quantity =q= of each
ingredient composing it. The goal is to find the right quantity =q= for each ingredient such that \sum_{i=0}^{n} c_i * q_i = T.
T behing the target number of calories that you want for your recipe. Exemple: I want to make a recipe composed of oats, milk, eggs, flakseeds and peanut butter 
such that the total number of calories for the recipe is 600 kcal; how much of each ingredient should I take? This is the purpose of this repository.

** How it works 

[[file:img/tuto.png]]
** Roadmap
- [ ] Add ingredients
- [ ] Remove ingredients
- [ ] Handle more units (currently only grams, next: liters, units, etc.)
- [ ] Can choose the range for proteins, carbohydrates and fats (eg. I want a 600kcal recipe with at least 30g of proteins)
- [ ] Optimize the PRAL index (how acid the recipe is)
- ... Don't hesitate to add issues including the features you'd like to see
